> Okta and Auth0 are on the https://auth0.com/blog/raising-the-bar-on-identity-one-year-of-okta-auth0/[same team now], so this example shows you how to use both. https://auth0.com[Auth0] is an easy to implement, adaptable authentication and authorization platform. Basically, we make your login box awesome.
> https://developer.okta.com/[Okta] has authentication and user management APIs that reduce development time with instant-on, scalable user infrastructure.
>
> https://github.com/mraible[@mraible]'s recommendation: use Okta for this tutorial because the https://cli.okta.com[Okta CLI] automates most of it for you!
